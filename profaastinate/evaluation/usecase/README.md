4 functions.

First one receives a pdf file and checks it's metadata and file size

Second one checks the pdf for virusses (by reading it in and seeing if anything goes wrong :) )

Third one performs OCR on the pdf and creates an annotated pdf

Fourth one gets the text from the pdf and sends it via mail (just print it to sysout)
